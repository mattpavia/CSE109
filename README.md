CSE109
======

My final project for CSE109 (Systems Software) at Lehigh University. It is a compiler that takes a file containing directions and outputs the result.

USAGE
=====

Run `./make` to build the project.

Run `./p8 $1` with `$1` being some file with the compiler's syntax. Example files can be found in the examples folder.
